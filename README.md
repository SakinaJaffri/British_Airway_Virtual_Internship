## Overview

This internship focuses on two main tasks:

1. **Web Scraping for Insights**: We'll gather and analyze airline reviews to gain valuable insights into customer sentiments.
2. **Predicting Buying Behavior**: Using customer booking data, we'll develop a predictive model to understand what drives customer purchasing decisions.

## Aim

The goal of this internship is to leverage analytical skills to make impactful recommendations, tools, and models that directly influence real-world business decisions at British Airways. Our aim is to drive cost reduction and revenue growth through data-driven insights.

## Technologies

We'll primarily use Python for data analysis and modeling.

## Data

We'll be working with two main datasets:
- **Airline Reviews**: Scraped from Skytrax and saved in `BA_reviews.csv`.
- **Customer Bookings**: Stored in `customer_booking.csv`.

## Results

Our findings and insights will be presented in PowerPoint slides, showcasing the outcomes of our web scraping efforts and predictive modeling of customer buying behavior.
